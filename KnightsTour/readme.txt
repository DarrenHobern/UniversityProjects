Panberry implementation requires even board sizes, and will work for any value which is a power of 2.
eg; 2,4,8,16,etc
The base cases 6,8,10 will work but these are hard coded results.
The values 12, 14, 18, and 20 will work also, the algorithm to solve the
NxN board where N is odd but missing the top left square has not been implemented
which is why this doesn't work for any even value.
